      <p>
        Wondering why the peaches you bought this time taste different than last
        time? You might have purchased the wrong variety. Did you know that
        there is something called a PLU code that identifies each type of fruit?
        Paying attention to these codes and making a note of them can help you
        remember which type of fruit to buy next time.
