# WEB103 Project 2 - *Fruit Notebook*

Submitted by: **Yueying Ke**

About this web app: **Wondering why the peaches you bought this time taste different than last time? You might have purchased the wrong variety. Did you know that there is something called a PLU code that identifies each type of fruit? Paying attention to these codes and making a note of them can help you remember which type of fruit to buy next time.**

Time spent: **6** hours

## Notes

"It seems that Railway automatically converts column names to lowercase. I had a problem with the client-side not being able to read the 'PLU_Code' column. I noticed that in the Railway app, it converts 'PLU_Code' to 'plu_code.' After I changed the casing on the client side, it worked.
